The netbook market has become watered down with so many competitors trying to cash in on the new craze, including but not limited to netbooks from companies such as Asus, Acer, Dell, MSI Wind, and Sony. Finally though, one company has decided to release a fully open netbook for those of us who love open stuff. Lemote's 8.9 inch [YeeLoong netbook](www.lemote.com/english/yeeloong9c.html) doesn't look fantastic by any means, and it sports a processor barely half as powerful as it's competitors, but it's definitely a step in the right direction.

The information given on Lemote's site is very limited, but from what I can tell the YeeLong netbook won't sport internal wireless or an internal webcam or any of that jazz (though they do offer a USB wifi "extension", whatever that means), but it will have a competitive price. If the price is cheap enough perhaps I'll buy one just to support open hardware
