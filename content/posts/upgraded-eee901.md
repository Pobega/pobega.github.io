I finally got the chance to buy a new Eee PC before leaving for college (to be exact, it arrived six days before I leave) and it's great. Besides the processor being more powerful, I get three to five hours of battery life and my operating system is extremely responsive.

The video card is also an upgraded Intel card (though it doesn't make **that** much of a difference, really) which helps a small bit when it comes to gaming.

The best part of the Eee 901 is the improved build quality; the hardware feels a lot nicer and less prone to breakage, which I experienced pretty often with my Eee PC 900.
