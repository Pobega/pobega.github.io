I got my acceptance letter from SUNY IT today, it put me in a pretty good mood. Finally, I'll be out of the cruddy CUNY system and in a **real** tech school. No more bullshit Computer Science professors or retarded classes (a web design class where they teach you basic HTML in six months? No way!) for good.

I've been telling all my friends that I'm leaving in a few weeks, and I am getting mixed reactions. Some are happy for me, some are upset to see me go, but they all ask me the same thing; *What are you doing before you go?* It sounds like a question you ask someone when they are on their death bed. Is there something I'm supposed to do before I leave for school? Or are they just trying to squeeze a free party out of me? Perhaps I just don't understand how most people think. Oh well. At least I'll be off of this godforsaken island in just under a month.
