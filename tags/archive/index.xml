      <description>For the last week I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Drivel &amp;ndash; a GNOME application for blogging from your desktop. The problem with using Drivel for a Wordpress blog is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support multiple categories or even tags! Luckily, I&amp;rsquo;ve found a nice alternative that integrated with my favorite text editor; Vimpress!
Vimpress supports categories and tags, as well as the ability to edit previous posts. My only quarry with Vim is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow the deletion of older entries, for which I&amp;rsquo;m still forced to login to my Wordpress dashboard to do.</description>

      <title>Advance Wars by Web - Free Browser Game</title>

      <description>Advance Wars is one of the best turn based strategy games ever. Each separate games offers balance between both opponents without one side having an obvious advantage (like with the leveling system of Fire Emblem). A website called Advance Wars by Web lets users play Advance Wars online against other players through a simple web interface. Those who are familiar with the Gameboy Advance series should be able to get comfortable with the AWBW interface quickly.</description>

      <title>Celeron M vs. Atom 270</title>

      <description>Ah, the question everyone asks. Celeron M vs Atom N270 for netbook computers (VIA is ruled out here, as it is outperformed by both in most benchmark tests). A note before I continue writing this article, I don&amp;rsquo;t actually own a netbook with an N270 processor, so the comparisons are based on my friend Quack&amp;rsquo;s Acer Aspire One.
Day to Day Usage: In day to day usage, the Intel Atom outperforms the Celeron M in almost every field.</description>

      <description>I got my acceptance letter from SUNY IT today, it put me in a pretty good mood. Finally, I&amp;rsquo;ll be out of the cruddy CUNY system and in a real tech school. No more bullshit Computer Science professors or retarded classes (a web design class where they teach you basic HTML in six months? No way!) for good.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling all my friends that I&amp;rsquo;m leaving in a few weeks, and I am getting mixed reactions.</description>
