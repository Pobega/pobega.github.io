      <title>Fixing Suspend Issues Caused By Intel 9260 Bluetooth</title>

      <description>Last week I received my Lenovo ThinkPad T495s, a new T-series line of ThinkPads from Lenovo that uses AMD processors instead of Intel. Everything so far is working perfectly (after getting a patched Systemd) except suspend.
It seems to be caused by the Intel 9260&amp;rsquo;s bluetooth device waking the machine up after it enters hibernation. If you own a device with an Intel 9260 you can verify yourself that the wakeup of this device is set to &amp;lsquo;enabled&amp;rsquo; by doing cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/power/wakeup.</description>

      <description>Ah, the question everyone asks. Celeron M vs Atom N270 for netbook computers (VIA is ruled out here, as it is outperformed by both in most benchmark tests). A note before I continue writing this article, I don&amp;rsquo;t actually own a netbook with an N270 processor, so the comparisons are based on my friend Quack&amp;rsquo;s Acer Aspire One.
Day to Day Usage: In day to day usage, the Intel Atom outperforms the Celeron M in almost every field.</description>
