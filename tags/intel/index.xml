      <description>Note: This seems to have been fixed by upstream between 5.2.7 and 5.2.11 on Fedora 30 so this workaround is no longer needed.
Last week I received my Lenovo ThinkPad T495s, a new T-series line of ThinkPads from Lenovo that uses AMD processors instead of Intel. Everything so far is working perfectly (after getting a patched Systemd) except suspend.
(Update: see my full T495s review if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in reading more about the laptop.</description>

      <title>Celeron M vs Atom N270</title>

      <description>Ah, the question everyone asks. Celeron M vs Atom N270 for netbook computers (VIA is ruled out here, as it is outperformed by both in most benchmark tests). A note before I continue writing this article, I don&amp;rsquo;t actually own a netbook with an N270 processor, so the comparisons are based on my friend Quack&amp;rsquo;s Acer Aspire One.
Day to Day Usage: In day to day usage, the Intel Atom outperforms the Celeron M in almost every field.</description>
