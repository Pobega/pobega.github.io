      <description>Lenovo&amp;rsquo;s first T-series AMD ThinkPads prove that they can stand with the big boys  Earlier in 2019 Lenovo announced that they were adding new ThinkPads with AMD Pro processors to their lineup. As someone who&amp;rsquo;s spent the last few years trying to migrate away from Intel this appealed to me. After waiting months Lenovo finally dropped three new laptops: The ThinkPad T495, T495s and X395.
For the unaware, the AMD Pro CPUs ship with mobile Vega APUs (Vega 8 or 10 depending on the CPU configuration) which are integrated cards that pack a little more &amp;lsquo;oomph&amp;rsquo; than Intel&amp;rsquo;s offerings.</description>
