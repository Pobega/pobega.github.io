      <description>So, I installed the Debian flashplayer-mozilla package the other day just to try out a game (Dofus, to be exact) while simultaneously voice chatting with a friend, when crash completely segfaulted and crashed my laptop. After rebooting and calling my friend back he complained about the quality of my voice &amp;ndash; Apparently flash player did something to my microphone and now it&amp;rsquo;s borked..
My theory for how this happened is that I was using my microphone while flash was trying to access it (since Adobe&amp;rsquo;s flash player has mic and webcam access), Adobe flash panicked, and crashed (while still trying to access the mic) which caused a system crash and microphone hardware failure.</description>
