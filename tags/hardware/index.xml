      <description>The last time I splurged on a laptop was back when the Intel Core 2 Duo was the newest CPU on the market. Nowadays, I tend to just use EeePCs or budget i3 laptops to get my work done. With graduation approaching and senior projects looming I decided I wanted something powerful, and it needed to be fully Linux compatible. After a bit of research I decided on the Clevo W740SU, also known as the Callisto 1413 sold by Mythlogic, the Galago Ultrapro sold by System76, the Zeus Hercules as sold by CyberpowerPC, and various other names from other resellers.</description>

      <title>Introduction; the World&#39;s First Fully Open Netbook</title>
      <link>https://pobe.ga/posts/first-fully-open-netbook/</link>

      <description>The netbook market has become watered down with so many competitors trying to cash in on the new craze, including but not limited to netbooks from companies such as Asus, Acer, Dell, MSI Wind, and Sony. Finally though, one company has decided to release a fully open netbook for those of us who love open stuff. Lemote&amp;rsquo;s 8.9 inch YeeLoong netbook doesn&amp;rsquo;t look fantastic by any means, and it sports a processor barely half as powerful as it&amp;rsquo;s competitors, but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely a step in the right direction.</description>

      <title>Finally upgraded my Eee PC 900 - Eee PC 901</title>

      <description>I finally got the chance to buy a new Eee PC before leaving for college (to be exact, it arrived six days before I leave) and it&amp;rsquo;s great. Besides the processor being more powerful, I get three to five hours of battery life and my operating system is extremely responsive.
The video card is also an upgraded Intel card (though it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make that much of a difference, really) which helps a small bit when it comes to gaming.</description>

      <title>New Kernel (2.6.27.9) Upgrade on my Eee</title>
      <link>https://pobe.ga/posts/new-kernel-eee/</link>

      <description>So I upgraded my kernel from my very outdated 2.6.25-* kernel to 2.6.27.9, and I have to say I&amp;rsquo;m impressed.
I ditched my old MadWiFi drivers (contrib) for fully free and open source ath5k modules (built right into the kernel!), as well as having my ethernet built in (non-modular) and an improvement in boot time (under 2 seconds, but still)
I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting up a .deb and .config when I get around to it, I need to fix a little bit more (the webcam doesn&amp;rsquo;t work out of the box, I&amp;rsquo;m probably going to need to compile that into the kernel too).</description>

      <title>Celeron M vs. Atom 270</title>
      <link>https://pobe.ga/posts/celeronm-vs-atomn270/</link>

      <description>Ah, the question everyone asks. Celeron M vs Atom N270 for netbook computers (VIA is ruled out here, as it is outperformed by both in most benchmark tests). A note before I continue writing this article, I don&amp;rsquo;t actually own a netbook with an N270 processor, so the comparisons are based on my friend Quack&amp;rsquo;s Acer Aspire One.
Day to Day Usage: In day to day usage, the Intel Atom outperforms the Celeron M in almost every field.</description>
