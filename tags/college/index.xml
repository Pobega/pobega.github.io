      <description>So I finally arrived at school, only to find that my college has decided to block IRC on the campus wifi. Weirdly enough, they allow AIM/MSN/Jabber/Skype/Ekiga/etc traffic, but not IRC. According to the IT department &amp;ldquo;IRC is commonly used to spread viruses&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how valid that is, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from trying to connect to my usual IRC networks.
Luckily all they did was block the common (6000~7000) IRC ports, which meant that I could still get on any networks that offered alternate ports.</description>

      <description>I got my acceptance letter from SUNY IT today, it put me in a pretty good mood. Finally, I&amp;rsquo;ll be out of the cruddy CUNY system and in a real tech school. No more bullshit Computer Science professors or retarded classes (a web design class where they teach you basic HTML in six months? No way!) for good.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling all my friends that I&amp;rsquo;m leaving in a few weeks, and I am getting mixed reactions.</description>
