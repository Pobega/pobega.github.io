      <description>So I finally arrived at school, only to find that my college has decided to block IRC on the campus wifi. Weirdly enough, they allow AIM/MSN/Jabber/Skype/Ekiga/etc traffic, but not IRC. According to the IT department &amp;ldquo;IRC is commonly used to spread viruses&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how valid that is, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from trying to connect to my usual IRC networks.
Luckily all they did was block the common (6000~7000) IRC ports, which meant that I could still get on any networks that offered alternate ports.</description>
